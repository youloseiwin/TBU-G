we constructed an  Teaching Gesture Video Dataset in which the classification attributes of teacher gestures are defined by the interaction between the gestures and the surrounding environment. TBU-G dataset contains 2,908 video samples, covering 8 subjects and 8 typical teacher gesture behaviors. To our best knowledge, it is the largest teacher gesture dataset.
